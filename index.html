    <!-- 17:30, The reason it needs the image width, cause the browser doesn't know the size of the image before it loads. That's why we need to tell the browser the actual full width image size of the images in the srcset. -->
    <!-- You can take the EXTRA optional step by telling the browser how big the image will be at various screen sizes by using media queries using the sizes attribute.  -->

    <!-- The above sizes acts exactly like your css media query and should use the same configuation. What above is saying is: at breakpoint min-width 600px, my image is 50vw aka at 600px and bigger, my image is taking up half the view port. And the rest of the time, it's taking up 100 percent. The last one with no media query is all other cases. -->
